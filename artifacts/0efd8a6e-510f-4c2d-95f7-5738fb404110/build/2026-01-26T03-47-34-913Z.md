# Build Plan

Job: 0efd8a6e-510f-4c2d-95f7-5738fb404110
Code: plumber-scheduling-app-super-WNNP

## Stack
- Next.js App Router
- Minimal in-repo JSON persistence (artifacts + runs)

## Implementation steps
1) Create booking form page
2) Create admin dashboard page
3) Wire API routes for create/list/update
4) Add basic styling

## Notes
This is currently a template artifact written by CI. Next step is having an Engineer agent actually implement code changes and commit them.
